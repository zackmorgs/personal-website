					<p>NorthShore Care is dedicated to getting your order to you as quickly and discreetly as possible. Order by 5pm Central time Monday - Friday and your package will ship same day.</p>
					<h3>Discreet Home Delivery</h3>
					<p>All orders from NorthShore Care Supply ship in plain, unmarked boxes or envelopes to maintain your privacy. Even the shipping label does not mention medical supplies. The return address states our parent company name of "Samela, Inc./NorthShore".</p>
					<h3>Fast, Reliable Shipping</h3>
					<p>Shipping Time: Most orders received Monday - Friday before 5pm will ship the same day, provided the product ordered is in-stock. Orders placed after 5pm Friday through Sunday, or on holidays, will ship on the next business day. You may receive notification of orders being processed and shipping tracking numbers on weekends and holidays, even though they will physically ship the next business day.</p>
					<p>We cannot guarantee when an order will arrive. Consider any shipping or transit time offered to you as an estimate. We encourage you to order in a timely fashion to avoid delays caused by shipping or product availability. Most items ship from our warehouse in Buffalo Grove, Illinois (ZIP 60089).</p>
