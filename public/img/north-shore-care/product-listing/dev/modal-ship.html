Orders placed after 5pm Friday through Sunday, or on holidays, will ship on the next business day.  You may receive notification of orders being processed and shipping tracking numbers on weekends and holidays, even though they will physically ship the next business day.</p>
					<p>We cannot guarantee when an order will arrive. Consider any shipping or transit time offered to you as an estimate. We encourage you to order in a timely fashion to avoid delays caused by shipping or product availability. Most items ship from our warehouse in Buffalo Grove, Illinois (ZIP 60089). </p><p>For certain items or promotions, Free Ground Delivery may be offered through the use of a specified coupon code. Use of the coupon code online or over the phone is required to receive this promotion.
