			<p>NorthShore Care is dedicated to getting your order to you as quickly and discreetly as possible.  Order by 5 PM Central time Monday - Friday and your package will ship same day. </p>
			<h3>Discreet Home Delivery</h3>
			<p>All orders from NorthShore Care Supply ship in plain, unmarked boxes or envelopes to maintain your privacy. Even the shipping label does not mention medical supplies. The return address states our parent company name of "Samela, Inc./NorthShore".</p>
			<h3>Fast, Reliable Shipping</h3>
			<p>Shipping Time -- Most orders received before 5:00PM Central will ship the same day, provided the product ordered is in-stock. In the rare occurrence that an item is not in-stock, we will make every attempt to have the item shipped directly from the manufacturer to avoid any delay for our customers. Even though orders may be processed and tracking numbers assigned on weekends and holidays, orders will not physically ship until the next business day.</p>
			<p>We cannot guarantee when an order will arrive. Consider any shipping or transit time offered to you only as an estimate. We encourage you to order in a timely fashion to avoid delays caused by shipping or product availability. Most items ship from our warehouse in Buffalo Grove, Illinois (ZIP 60089). For certain items or promotions, Free Ground Delivery may be offered through the use of a specified coupon code. Use of the coupon code online or over the phone is required to receive this promotion. Additionally, even when using valid coupon, free shipping only applies to locations within the 48 contiguous states. We reserve the right to bill additional funds if a free shipping coupon is used with a delivery location outside the contiguous US. Most orders with free ground delivery ship via FedEx Ground. However, we reserve the right to ship via alternate means at our discretion.</p>
